# Challenge Notes

- “Baker Street begins where the letter yields to the number.”  
  → Convert the letter to its alphabet index (A=1, B=2, …).

- “When the mind grows restless, Holmes seeks a remedy—not in noise, but in chemistry.  
  A quiet vial, precisely measured… not pure, but diluted to a careful fraction.  
  Let x be the dose, let the curve confess its rise and fall—”  
  → Treat **x** as the input “dose” value and substitute the given dose into the function (for this challenge: **x = 7**).  
  → The “diluted fraction” indicates the output will be a **decimal value between 0 and 1**.

- “A good detective counts till the third mark.”  
  → Round the final answer to **3 decimal places**.

Final computed answer: **0.567**
